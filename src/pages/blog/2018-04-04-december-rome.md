title: 'DECEMBER: ROME'

  Rome has the strong distinction of being home to two of the worlds most
  dominant religions/cultures; the Ancient Romans and the Catholics. Much of its
  beauty comes from the fact that for once the Christians repurposed rather than
  destroyed the architecture of the ‘pagans’.

The city is old, older than London. It is strange someone who identifies closest as a Londoner to be somewhere that makes thats city seem a recent addition to the world stage. 

Rome is a strange mix, small winding roads lead to great open piazza. Only a handful of large roads exist in the centre and the act of crossing them shows why Rome is still a religious city.
