  Gaudiâ€™s influence can be felt throughout the city, even though there are in
  truth only a small number of his buildings in a large sprawling city the
  influence of colour and shape make Barcelona an interesting city. Whilst it
  has many of the dull square buildings that infest major cities, it also has
  old churches in immaculate repair and colourful shapes and sculptures
  scattered through the city.

Barcelona shines when the sun sets and the colours of the sky merge with the colours of the buildings.

The major roads in Barcelona are huge, dividing the city like bones.
